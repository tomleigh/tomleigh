<h3>Tom Leigh</h3>

Hi! I‚Äôm Tom. I am currently in my fourth year of university, studying a Bachelor of Advanced Computing and Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Sydney, with majors in computer science and finance.

<h4>üë®‚Äçüíª Professional Work</h4>
My professional experience to date includes development of a cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile application in C#, in which I proudly developed features including peer-to-peer messaging, push-notifications, and cloud data storage.

Furthermore, I have also worked professionally in website development, design, and SEO to create the [aschoolfortomorrow.com](https://www.aschoolfortomorrow.com) website. I achieved Google Lighthouse scores of 100% for best practices, and 99% for desktop performance. 

<h4>‚úèÔ∏è Personal Projects & Interests</h4>
My passion for technology extends beyond a professional scope ‚Äì in which I have explored personal projects in mobile development, cloud computing, AI and more. I am incredibly proud to have created multiple 3D mobile applications from self-taught software skills, achieving over 57,400 accumulative downloads from a global audience.

My personal interests include guitar, surfing, and travel. I love living an active lifestyle and have recently had the opportunity to climb Everest Base Camp and summit Kala Patthar in the Himalayas. 

Thanks for viewing my GitHub profile and I warmly invite you to reach out if you would like to know anything more about me.
